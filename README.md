The emerging global infectious COVID-19 coronavirus disease by novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) presents critical fulminations to global public health and the economy since it was identified in late December 2019 in China.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause illnesses ranging widely in severity. The first known severe illness caused by a coronavirus appeared with the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in China. A second outbreak of severe illness originated in 2012 in Saudi Arabia with the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). And now the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19.

Here we are going to play with the COVID2â€“19 DNA sequence data using python and also compare the similarity among COVID-19/COV2, MERS, and SARS. At the end we'll conclude that how COVID-19 is closely related to SARS.
